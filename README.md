# About 
Here I'm introducing my skills with standard commands in the terminal.
Every solution of the task is a GIF-file so you may see with ease how I manage usual things like creating, moving, deleting folders and files. In the ''Tasks" folder you'll find the tasks itself, but there's no need of it because each GIF-file displays both solution and task.
